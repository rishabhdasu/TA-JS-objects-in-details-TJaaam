// # More about class

// - Create a class named `Square` which accepts one parameter `side` and will set two property `width` and `height` to the value of `side`.

class Square {
    constructor(side) {
        this.width = side;
        this.height = side;
    }
        description() {
            return alert(`The square is ${this.width} X ${this.height}`);
        }
}
// - Add a method name `description` that will alert a message saying `The square is ${width} x ${height}`

class Square {
    constructor(side) {
        this.width = side;
        this.height = side;
    }
        description() {
            return alert(`The square is ${this.width} X ${this.height}`);
        }
}

// - Create a method inside the class named `calcArea` that will return the area of the square.

class Square {
    constructor(side) {
        this.width = side;
        this.height = side;
    }
        description() {
            return alert(`The square is ${this.width} X ${this.height}`);
        }
}

// - Create a `area` getter method using which we can get the area of the square.

// - Create a `area` setter method that will accept the area of the square. Based on the value of area it will set the value of `width` and `height`.

// - Create a static method named `isEqual` which accepts two `square` object with `width` and `height` property. If the area of both square is same it will return `true` or `false`.

// - Create two instance of the `Square` class

// - Check the `area` getter method on both square. Check the `area` property on one square more than 4 times.

// - Check the `isEqual` method and pass the two instance you created above.

// ## User Class

// - Create a `User` class that accepts `firstName` and `lastName` property

// - Create a getter method named `fullName` that will return the full name of the person.

// - Create a `fullName` setter method that will accept full name parameter of the person. It will update the `firstName` and `lastName` based on the input. Say if the user passed `Arya Stark` it will update the `firstName` to `Arya` and `lastName` to `Stark`. It will also change one condition if the length of the name passed is less than 5 characters it will alert a message saying `Full name should be more than 5 characters`

// - Create a method named `nameContains` which will accept string and will return `true` or `false` based on if the name of the user contains the text that passed by user.

// - Create two instance of the `User` class

// - Check by using the `fullName` setter method with name bigger than 5 characters.

// - Check by using the `fullName` setter method with name less than 5 characters.

// - Check the `fullName` using getter

// - Check the `nameContains` method
